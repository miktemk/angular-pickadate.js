angular-pickadate.js
====================

Angularjs extension for the slick date/time picker, [pickadate.js by Amsul](http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/)

Add the module as a dependency to your application module:

```js
var myAppModule = angular.module('MyApp', ['ngDatePicker'])
```

The use is very simple once you add the dependency:

    <input type="text" pick-a-date="curDate" />
    <input type="text" pick-a-time="curDate" />

I went over my head for you guys and added constraints for min/max. Here is how you can use them. Merry xmas!

    From: <input type="text" pick-a-date="startDate" max-date="endDate" />
    To: <input type="text" pick-a-date="endDate" min-date="startDate" />

### Options

[pickadate.js by Amsul](http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/) has a lot of options. You can control the options by
through these directives as well.
For the pick-a-date directive use `pick-a-date-options`.
For the pick-a-time directive use `pick-a-time-options`.
Pass in a structure like this { ... } with all the options you can think of. They will be passed to the directive.
Example:

    <input type="text" pick-a-date="curDate" pick-a-date-options="{ format: 'dd/mm/yy', selectYears: true }" />

### Notes

 - Please note that I am using the latest and greatest version of AngularJS (v1.2.12). If you try to use a crappy old version like 1.0.2, there will be errors.
 - For more information on the date filter in AngularJS please visit [http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/date].
 - Watch out for UTC times. Apparently the default way AngularJS serializes your time is with the Tâ€¦Z pattern, meaning it is the time in Greenwich.
